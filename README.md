A basic Translator Application for mobile platforms. It can automatically detect any language and directly translates into Turkish. 

- React Native based code. But I just tested for Android.
- Also supports Text to Speech features. You can listen the pronunciation of what you want to translate.
- Powered by Microsoft Translator API, which can be use for free for language translations.
- Target language can be change from the code. By default, I made any language to Turkish translation.
- If you want to make special language translations, just find out the related language code abbreviation (like EN, TR etc.) from MS Translator API documents.
